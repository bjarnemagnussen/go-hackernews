    <h2>{{.SiteShort}} Guidelines</h2>

    <p class="smaller">Based on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html/">Hacker News Guidelines</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        {{.SiteShort}} is a platform for friends of {{.Generator}}. It shall enable people to discover, share and
        discuss interesting thoughts, publications or web pieces about Bitcoin and its related fields. On the platform,
        anybody shall feel welcomed.
    </p>

    <h3>What to Submit?</h3>
    <p>
        On-Topic: Anything that {{.Generator}}ers would find interesting. That includes more than {{.Generator}}. If you
        had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity within
        a broader spectrum of {{.Generator}}.
    </p>
    <p>
        Off-Topic: Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's
        probably off-topic.
    </p>

    <h3>In Submissions</h3>
    <p>
        Please don't do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase or exclamation points, or saying how great
        an article is. It's implicit in submitting something that you think it's important.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please submit the original source. If a post reports on something found on another site, submit the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the title includes the name of the site, please take it out, because the site name will be displayed after
        the link.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you submit a video or pdf, please warn us by appending [video] or [pdf] to the title.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please submit the canonical URL and avoid link shorteners.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the title begins with a number or number + gratuitous adjective, we'd appreciate it if you'd crop it. E.g.
        translate "10 Ways To Do X" to "How To Do X," and "14 Amazing Ys" to "Ys." Exception: when the number is
        meaningful, e.g. "The 5 Platonic Solids."
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don't editorialize.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't post on {{.SiteShort}} to ask or tell us something.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't delete and repost the same story. Deletion is for things that shouldn't have been submitted in the
        first place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't submit so many links at once that the new page is dominated by your submissions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't solicit upvotes, comments, or submissions. Users should do those things when they run across something
        they personally find interesting, not because someone has content to promote.
    </p>

    <h3>In Comments</h3>
    <p>
        Be kind. Don't be snarky. Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more
        divisive. Have curious conversation; don't cross-examine.
    </p>
    <p>
        When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3"
        can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3."
    </p>
    <p>
        Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to
        criticize. Assume good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eschew flamebait. Don't introduce flamewar topics unless you have something genuinely new to say. Avoid
        unrelated controversies and generic tangents.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work. A good critical comment teaches us
        something.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't use {{.SiteShort}} for political or ideological battle. That destroys the curiosity this site
        exists for.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't comment on whether someone read an article. "Did you even read the article? It mentions that" can
        be shortened to "The article mentions that."
    </p>
    <p>
        Throwaway accounts are ok for sensitive information, but please don't create accounts routinely. {{.SiteShort}}
        is a communityâ€”users should have an identity that others can relate to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't use uppercase for emphasis. If you want to emphasize a word or phrase, put *asterisks* around it
        and it will get italicized.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't post insinuations about astroturfing, shilling, brigading, foreign agents and the like. It degrades
        discussion and is usually mistaken. If you're worried about abuse, email us and we'll look at the data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't complain that a submission is inappropriate. If a story is spam or off-topic, flag it. Don't feed
        egregious comments by replying; flag them instead. If you flag, please don't also comment that you did.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please don't comment about the voting on comments. It never does any good, and it makes boring reading.
    </p>
