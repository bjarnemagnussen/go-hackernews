        <h3>Show Us</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        Show Us is for something you've made that other people can play with. {{.SiteShort}} users can try it out, give
        you feedback, and ask questions in the thread.
    </p>
    <p>
        On topic: things people can run on their computers or hold in their hands. For hardware, you can post a video or
        detailed article. For books, a sample chapter is ok.
    </p>
    <p>
        Off topic: blog posts, sign-up pages, newsletters, lists, and other reading material. Those can't be tried out,
        so can't be Show Us. Make a regular submission instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project must be something you've worked on personally and which you're around to discuss.
    </p>
    <p>
        To post, <a href="submit">submit</a> a story whose title begins with "Show Us:".
    </p>
    <p>
        Every Show Us appears on <a href="/show/newest">show/newest</a>. Once it clears a small points threshold, it
        will appear on the <a href="show/popular">show</a> page in the top bar.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Show Us needn't be complicated or look slick. The community is comfortable with work that's at an early stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your work isn't ready for people to try out yet, please don't do a Show Us. Once it's ready, come back and do
        it then.
    </p>
    <p>
        New features and upgrades ("Foo 1.3.1 is out") generally aren't substantive enough to be a Show Us. A major
        overhaul is probably ok.</p>
    <p>
        Don't ask friends to upvote. That's not ok.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>In Comments</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        Be respectful. Anyone sharing work is making a contribution, however modest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ask questions out of curiosity. Don't cross-examine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of "you're doing it wrong", suggest alternatives. When someone is learning, help them learn
        more.
    </p>
    <p>
        When something isn't good, you needn't pretend that it is, but don't be gratuitously negative.
